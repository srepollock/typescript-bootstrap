# TypeScript Bootstrap

A TypeScript bootstrap project: to start your project out without hassle. This project aims to give you the best tools you need to start your project on the right foot. When forking this project to start out your own unique idea, take some time to fill out the information here in this README. Remember, just like this README, your README.md file is the first contact to the end user. Most people don't read any more documentation (although I'm sure you'll have lots!) and really they should be able to get started with no more information than from here. Give them everything they need to get started on their own wonderful project.  
The following is simply a template of information to give. It is not final, it is not correct, it is simply a guidline of best practices.

Now remove this part and fill out the rest with your unique project information. Everything below can be removed, but some can be updated with your project specific information.
*Remember to give credit where it is due.*
